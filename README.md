# police_bot
A bot using tensorflow image classification that identifies police officers by department (currently in a docker_Hub too) 

# How it works 
Using tensorflow image classifcation, the police bot identifies officers given an image and sorts them into a particular department.
Currently, the database I've been working on only has nypd and chicago pd dbs, but I will be expanding soon. 

# Why create this project? 
In light of recent events (6/4/20) with police brutality it has become clear that police must be held accountable to a higher degree
than before. In an effort to assist data sceintists and activists with data that can quantify police misconduct this bot has been trained to 
identify any image of police officers in either chicago or nypd and sorts them accordingly. All images are then provided to the Open OVersight project
which assists in the creation of a public database of police data for citizens to view, edit, and document personal cases of police 
misconduct with specific officers or departments. 

#How to Contribute 
if you find any pictures of officers in the NY or Chicago area, or even in your local area, please email me (officialrosnel@gmail.com) concerning
your submission. And if you'd like to assit in the training/development of the police_bot let me know!
